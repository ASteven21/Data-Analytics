#### Project Repository

This is my repository that consists of projects that I did to use the skills that I learned from DataCamp in order to be a data analyst.

By enrolling in several courses from DataCamp, I am currently able to do basic analysis using SQL, Python and R. From the three tools that I learned, I prefer to work with Python followed by SQL and R respectively. This is because I have been using Python eversince I entered university. After Python, I had an easier time working with SQL since I understand how it works relatively better compared to R.

By posting all of the projects that I did here, I am hoping that I could get some opportunities for an internship or an entry level job in the world of data analytics. Since there are a lot of projects that I did here, I posted some of the projects that I felt I did the best on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonius-steven-b25113201/details/projects/) page.
